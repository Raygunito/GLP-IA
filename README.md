# The Cognitive Crew
## Trois programmeurs, trois frères : voici leur histoire

<p>Le début de leur histoire est tourmentée</p>

<p>Projet GLP L2 info IA, 2022-2023</p>

<p>This project is about creating an app that help visualize how some standard AI algorithm works. The app will provide interactive visualizations for algorithms such as A* search, Q-learning, and MinMax optimization, allowing users to better understand how these algorithms function and how they can be applied in various scenarios.</p>

## Getting started

To use the program, you need to have at least Java 11 or + installed in your system. You can install Java [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

Once you have Java installed, you can open the program by openning a command line and by typing :

**`java -jar The_Cognitive_Crew.jar`**

## Updates

Successfully implemented algorithms:
- [x] MinMax
- [x] AStar
- [x] Q-Learning
- [ ] Neural Network
